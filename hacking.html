				Dice is a dice-rolling command-line tool and Python module, useful for role-playing games and general tomfoolery.
				It accepts die format strings in <code>1d6</code> format, but it also recognises more complicated strings such as <code>2d20+3</code> or <code>5z5*10</code>.
				(It is all explained in the bundled man page.)

				Four empires, rebel forces, a shady company, an &ldquo;attractive&rdquo; black hole and mysterious <a title="KqzoPhr">words</a>.
				Find out about the complex inter-planetary relations while you fly around, take on missions and get promotions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fly around, do missions and visit worlds unknown. These are some of the things you get to do while
				the story unfolds; a story about empires, rebels, alliances and backstabbing officials.

			<p class="name"><a href="#lcalc" id="lcalc">#</a> lCalc <span class="status finished">done</span></p>
			<p>
				A calculator using wxLua, which evaluates Lua expressions and statements. Stable and useful. <code>= 5</code> is short for <code>return 5</code>
				and <code>:a 6</code> is short for <code>return set(6,"a")</code>, which is a different way of saying <code>a = 6 ; return a</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The result of the previous calculation is stored in <code>_</code>, and a list of all history is kept in a table called <code>hist</code>, such that
				<code>hist[1] == _</code> and <code>hist[#hist]</code> is the first calculation executed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Previous expressions can be reached by using Ctrl+Up and Ctrl+Down.
			</p>
			<p>
				Results are shown on a white background, if the result is <code>nil</code>,
				the background is gray, and if there was an error, the error is shown on a
				red background.

			<p>
				LuaHub is a Lua library to access the GitHub API. Started because the <a class="github" href="http://github.com/repositories/random">Random Repository</a> function on GitHub returned so much crap*, and didn't provide any further parameters to choose from, for example minimum amount of watchers or commits.
			<p>
				* Projects with only an “initial commit” and an empty README, for example.

				Skeme is a top-down scheme generator, useful for programming courses and the like. It was written because the

				and repetitions (loops).
